questions:
- question: Who can I contact if I have questions about the TCR I was issued or if
    I’m having trouble complying?
  answer: Call your local LA Animal Services center if you have any questions or are
    having trouble complying. The Department aims to promote responsible pet ownership
    and wants to help pet owners to that end. The letter from the Department General
    Manager issuing your TCR should have the contact information for your neighborhood’s
    animal services center. If you do not have that information available, go to this
    page on the Department’s website, then click ‘Shelter Lookup’ to find your local
    Animal Services center.

- question: What does it mean to have my dog license revoked?
  answer: A revoked license means that your dog must be removed from the City of Los
    Angeles. It further prohibits you from maintaining any dog in the City of Los
    Angeles for three years. Failure to remove a dog from the City after its license
    has been revoked is a criminal misdemeanor.

    (the pet owner) has a right to appeal. Appeals are heard by the Department of
    Animal Services’ Board of Commissioners. MORE INFO
