- question: What happens if I do not comply with the TCR issued to me?
  answer: If you are alleged to be in violation of the TCR issued to you from a first
    hearing, the Department can request another administrative hearing. The purpose
    of that hearing would be to determine if your animal license should be revoked
    for failure to abide by the TCR. If you are found to be in violation at the second
    hearing, your license can be revoked; or, alternatively, your license can be reissued
    with additional or different TCR.

- question: Who can I contact if I have questions about the TCR I was issued or if
    I’m having trouble complying?
  answer: Call your local LA Animal Services center if you have any questions or are
    having trouble complying. The Department aims to promote responsible pet ownership
    and wants to help pet owners to that end. The letter from the Department General
    Manager issuing your TCR should have the contact information for your neighborhood’s
    animal services center. If you do not have that information available, go to this
    page on the Department’s website, then click ‘Shelter Lookup’ to find your local
    Animal Services center.

- question: What does it mean to have my dog license revoked?
  answer: A revoked license means that your dog must be removed from the City of Los
    Angeles. It further prohibits you from maintaining any dog in the City of Los
    Angeles for three years. Failure to remove a dog from the City after its license
    has been revoked is a criminal misdemeanor.

- question: Can I appeal the Department’s decision?
  answer: Yes. Respondents can appeal the Department’s decision. Only the Respondent
    (the pet owner) has a right to appeal. Appeals are heard by the Department of
    Animal Services’ Board of Commissioners. MORE INFO
