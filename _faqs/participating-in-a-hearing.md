questions:
- question: What if a witness wrote a statement out instead of appearing at the hearing?
    Can their written statement be submitted into evidence?
  answer: Written statements by people not physically present to testify at the hearing
    are typically not afforded weight by Hearing Examiners since such statements do
    not give the opposing party the opportunity to cross-examine that witness. This
    is especially true when the statement is not a sworn declaration under penalty
    of perjury.
