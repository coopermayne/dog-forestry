questions:
- question: What is the purpose of the hearing?
  answer: The hearing is a semi-judicial proceeding – something of an informal trial.
    It aims solely to gather evidence to ultimately determine whether the animal in
    question can safely be maintained in the City of Los Angeles. The hearing is only
    concerned with public safety and welfare – it does not address potential claims
    for money damages or other matters that would be reserved for civil litigation.
    The hearing is a public proceeding – anyone may attend and the audio of the proceedings
    is recorded.

- question: Why am I being summoned by the Los Angeles Department of Animal Services?
  answer: It has been alleged that an animal injured a person or another animal, and/or
    caused property damage within the City of Los Angeles. The Department believes
    you are either the victim of such an incident, or the owner of the animal involved
    in the incident(s), or a witness to the incident(s). You are being summoned to
    appear and testify at a hearing regarding the incident(s). Per Los Angeles Municipal
    Code Section 53.34.4, the Department must conduct a hearing to determine whether
    the animal poses a threat to public safety.

- question: What happens if I don't go?
  answer: |-
    If you are an alleged victim and don't come to the hearing, the case against the animal is very likely to be dismissed because your story won't have been taken under oath.  Moreover, victims do not have a right to appeal the decision -- the hearing is the only opportunity for them to tell their story to the Department on the record.

    If you are a pet owner and don't come to the hearing, only the alleged victim's side of the story will be told, meaning the outcome of the hearing could be worse than it would be if you were to appear and also tell your side of the story.  Moreover, pet owners can only appeal the ultimate decision reached by the Department if they appear for the hearing.
