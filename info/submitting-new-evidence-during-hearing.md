Additional documents, photographs, or videos can be submitted as evidence during the hearing if they are relevant to the incident(s). Additional relevant evidence is welcome and encouraged. Bear in mind that in addition to the audio recording of the hearing, any additional evidence submitted during the hearing becomes public record and can be disclosed upon request. Also bear in mind that, in order to consider the evidence, the Hearing Examiner will have to ask you to explain what the evidence is and what its relevance to the case is. The opposing party also must have an opportunity to examine the evidence and ask you questions about it on cross-examination.

For victims/complaining witnesses, documents from health care providers detailing medical treatment received from the alleged animal incident can be especially helpful to the Hearing Examiner. Photographs of injuries or the scene of the incident can also be helpful. Documents such as bills or invoices are less helpful without showing what specific medical treatment was received.

For animal owners/respondents, documents or photographs showing how the dog is confined or maintained at home – including photographs of gates, fences, etc. – can be especially helpful to the Hearing Examiner. Documents detailing any professional training the animal has received can also be helpful. Finally, evidence of any remedial measures taken since the alleged incident (for example: additional locks on gates at home) can also be helpful to the Hearing Examiner.

Evidence attempting to attest to the character of the dog by neighbors, friends, etc. are not typically afforded much weight by Hearing Examiners. This is especially true when the evidence is a written statement by someone who is not physically present to testify at the hearing.
