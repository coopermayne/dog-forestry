In accordance with Los Angeles Municipal Code 53.34.4, the Hearing Examiner can recommend to the General Manager one of four possible outcomes:

## 1. Dismissal

If the evidence is insufficient to determine that a bite, attack, or injury occurred; or, if the bite, attack or injury occurred but was minimal in nature, the case will be dismissed.

## 2. Animal License Reissued with Terms & Conditions on Ownership

If the evidence presented shows that a bite, attack or injury occurred, but the severity of the incident would not warrant declaring the animal “dangerous,” the owner’s privilege of keeping the dog in Los Angeles will be extended – with reasonable terms, conditions, and restrictions intended to prevent circumstances like those that gave rise to the need for a hearing. For more information about the issuance of and compliance with Terms & Conditions, see \[LINK TO SECTION ON TERMS & CONDITIONS\].

## 3. Animal License Revoked

If the evidence presented shows that a bite, attack or injury occurred, and that the Respondents are unwilling or unable to take corrective measures (or if they fail to appear at the hearing), their license to own animals in the City of Los Angeles may be revoked. A revoked license means that the animal must be removed from the City of Los Angeles. It further prohibits the Respondent from maintaining any dog in the City of Los Angeles for three years. Failure to remove a dog from the City after its license has been revoked is a criminal misdemeanor.

## 4. Animal Declared Dangerous and Destroyed

If the evidence presented shows that the attack, bite, or injury is so severe that the Department believes the dog cannot be maintained either inside or outside Los Angeles without jeopardizing public safety, the animal will be declared dangerous and humanely killed. It is illegal to keep any animal declared to be dangerous. This outcome is only availed of in the most extreme circumstances.
